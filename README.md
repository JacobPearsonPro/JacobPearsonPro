## I'm seeking an entry level Fullstack Web Development position. I'd already gone through a Computer Networking and Repair course at Calhoun Area Career Center during Highschool and picked up a CompTIA A+ Certification. I'd also ended up helping my class with designing a new Flight Simulation computer for the Aviation class there, which was quite fun.

### Goals for this course.

- Acquire sufficient HTML, CSS, and Javascript experience and training as to understand how to make a good website.
- Gain connections and opportunities to meet with employers and thus aid in gaining a long term career.
- Design a major capstone project with which to show the skills I've learned.
